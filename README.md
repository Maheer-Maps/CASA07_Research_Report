### Project Overview  
This quantitative study examines how access to natural assets affects childhood obesity rates across London boroughs pre- and post-COVID. Using ordinal logistic regression, we analyse age-specific relationships between green space features and healthy weight outcomes in Reception (4-5 years) and Year 6 (10-11 years) students.
